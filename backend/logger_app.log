In more than 20 years of public life, I have steadfastly supported Israel and its people in both word and
deed, including by building medical facilities there, co-founding a leadership center, supporting its
innovative local programs and funding other good causes. I have never gotten involved in its domestic

And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\nSource: 5-pl\nContent: More support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.\nSource: 34-pl\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\nSOURCES:\n\nQUESTION: {question}\n=========\n{summaries}\n=========\nFINAL ANSWER:', template_format='f-string', validate_template=True), llm=ChatOpenAI(verbose=False, callback_manager=<langchain.callbacks.shared.SharedCallbackManager object at 0x109c025f0>, client=<class 'openai.api_resources.chat_completion.ChatCompletion'>, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo', temperature=0.0, model_kwargs={}, openai_api_key='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', openai_organization=None, request_timeout=60, max_retries=6, streaming=False, n=1, max_tokens=None), output_key='text'), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template='Content: {page_content}\nSource: {source}', template_format='f-string', validate_template=True), document_variable_name='summaries'), collapse_document_chain=None, document_variable_name='context', return_intermediate_steps=True), question_generator=LLMChain(memory=None, callback_manager=<langchain.callbacks.shared.SharedCallbackManager object at 0x109c025f0>, verbose=False, prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['chat_history', 'question'], output_parser=None, partial_variables={}, template='Given the following conversation and a follow up question, rephrase the follow up question to be a standalone question.\n\nChat History:\n{chat_history}\nFollow Up Input: {question}\nStandalone question:', template_format='f-string', validate_template=True), llm=ChatOpenAI(verbose=False, callback_manager=<langchain.callbacks.shared.SharedCallbackManager object at 0x109c025f0>, client=<class 'openai.api_resources.chat_completion.ChatCompletion'>, model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo', temperature=0.0, model_kwargs={}, openai_api_key='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', openai_organization=None, request_timeout=60, max_retries=6, streaming=False, n=1, max_tokens=None), output_key='text'), output_key='answer', return_source_documents=True, get_chat_history=None, retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain.vectorstores.pinecone.Pinecone object at 0x13bece140>, search_type='similarity', search_kwargs={}), max_tokens_limit=None)
